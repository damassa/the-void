Cho\'Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak it\'s name. It\'s fellows have been poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into Runeterra, where they can visit their own personal paradise of horror upon the world. They are called the Voidborn, creatures so ancient and terrible that they have been removed from history altogether. It is rumored that the Voidborn command vast armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once driven from Runeterra by powerful magic lost to antiquity. If such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true - that one day, the Voidborn will return. Even now, something dark stirs in Icathia. Cho\'Gath, an alien creature of malice and violence, causes all but the most stalwart to cringe in fear. Cho\'Gath even appears to feed on its predations, growing and swelling as it gorges itself.

(2, 'Kassadin', 'The Void Walker', 'Assassin', 'High', 'Kassadin started life as a lowly offcast, walking the harsh sands of the Great Sai alongside merchant caravans to draw predators away from their more valuable goods. He survived many of these treks across the desert, and began to serve less as bait, and more as a guide. The foreign tongues that sought his talents, вЂњKas sai a dyn?вЂќ or вЂњwhom does the desert know?вЂќ often slurred their Shuriman, and so he became fondly known as Kassadin in the back alleys and markets of Bel\'zhun. He spent many years exploring the ancient ruins of his homeland, making his employers exceedingly wealthy, but it wasn\'t until a dig near Zirima that he found a treasure of his ownвЂ”he fell in love with a woman from one of the desert tribes. With his wife and newborn daughter, Kassadin settled in a small village in the rocky canyons to the south. He was on the road often, his work sometimes requiring him to accompany particularly valuable relics to some faraway sponsor. But, no matter where his travels took him, Kassadin would always return with exciting tales from the world beyond. Journeying home from distant Piltover, Kassadin and his fellow caravaneers were watering their beasts at an oasis when they encountered the first terrified survivors stumbling out of the desert. They spoke of the disaster that had claimed their homes, as if the maw of the underworld itself had opened up to devour them. They had barely escaped with their lives. Fearing for his own family\'s safety, Kassadin left the others behind, riding hard, driving his mount almost to exhaustion. When he finally reached the place where his village had once stood, he found only shifting sand and rubble. He clawed at the debris until his hands bled, screaming out his wife and daughter\'s names, though no answer came. Days later, Kassadin\'s companions caught up to him, now just a broken and empty man weeping beneath the scorching sun. They dragged him back to Zirima, but Kassadin would go no further. For years, he tried to drown his grief, reduced to little more than a vagrantвЂ¦ until word reached town of \'the Prophet.\' Whispers of unspeakable horrors that dwelt beneath the earth, and of sacrifices made in their name, chilled Kassadin to the bone. He knew well the legends of old Icathia, and the fate that befell that accursed placeвЂ”if the Void had been deliberately drawn toward Shurima once more, then it had likely been the death of his entire village, and countless more besides. He also knew there were few, if any, who could stand against it. In that moment, Kassadin swore that he would avenge his wife and daughter, by destroying this insidious Prophet, and the source of his abyssal power. He was a man who had made his living by finding safe paths through the most dangerous places, and resolved to arm himself with the most arcane and esoteric weapons ever known in Valoran, fused with Zaunite ingenuity, and blessed by Ionian spirit-healers. He called in every favor he could, from scholars of antiquities to common smugglers, for their help inвЂ¦ acquiring what he sought. Many called him a madman, believing this the last time they would ever see their old friend aliveвЂ”Kassadin merely thanked them for their concern, and bid them farewell. He would face the Void alone. Last of all, he stole the infamous Nether Blade of Horok, the sword that had slain a thousand deceivers in the latter days of the empire. He could feel the cold pull of oblivion in its edge, but no longer had any regard for his own mortality, and nothing of his old life left to lose. Disguised in the robes of a pilgrim, more than a decade since he had last set foot anywhere near that desolate land, Kassadin made his way into Icathia. He would go where no man was ever meant to walk. He would have his vengeance, even if it killed him.', 'https://tinyurl.com/y8tpp6x3'),
(3, 'Kai\'Sa', 'Daughter of The Void', 'Marksman', 'Moderate', 'Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the fearless hunter of the Void known as KaiвЂ™Sa is how unremarkably her life began. She did not descend from tribal warriors hardened by generations of battle, nor was she summoned from distant lands to fight the unknowable menace lurking beneath Shurima. Rather, she was just an ordinary girl, born to loving parents who called the unforgiving southern deserts their home. This was where she would spend her days playing with friends, and her nights dreaming about her place in the world. In her tenth summer, the young girl KaisaвЂ™s destiny would be changed forever. Had she been older, she might have noticed more of the unusual events that had begun to unfold in the villagesвЂ”every day, her mother urged her stay home, for fear of strangers wandering the land, demanding tribute to dark powers below. Kaisa and her friends did not believe it, until one evening they came upon a pen of sacrificial goats bought from nomad herdsmen. Using the knife her father had given her on her eighth birthday, she cut their tethers and set the animals free into a nearby canyon. It seemed like a harmless prank, until the unthinkable happened. The ground began to quake, flashes of light scorched the sky, and the children ran for their lives. The Void had been awakened. A great rift split the bedrock, swallowing up Kaisa\'s village and everyone in it, leaving nothing behind but sand pierced with twisted columns as black as night. Kaisa regained consciousness to find herself trapped underground. She was filled with crippling fear, but there was still hope; she could hear the faint cries of other survivors. They called out to each other feebly, repeating their names one by one like a mantra. Sadly, by the third day, hers was the only voice left. Her friends and family were all gone. She was alone in the darkness. It was only when all seemed lost that she saw the light. She followed it down. Along the way, she found meager sustenance. Amid the debris left by the collapse were ragged waterskins, rotting peachesвЂ”anything to keep starvation at bay. But, eventually, Kaisa\'s hunger was replaced by fear once again. She found herself in a vast cavern, illuminated by an otherworldly purplish glow, and she could see she was no longer alone. Skittering creatures swarmed in the depths. The first that came for Kaisa was no bigger than her, and she clutched her knife in both hands, ready to defend herself. The voidling horror knocked her to the ground, but she drove the blade into its pulsing heart, and the two of them tumbled deeper into the abyss. The creature was seemingly dead, but its unnatural skin had taken hold upon the flesh of her arm. The dark shell tingled, but was hard as steel to the touch. In a panic, Kaisa broke her knife trying to remove it. But when the larger beasts came, she used it as a shield to make her escape. Soon enough, she realized the shell was becoming part of her. As her daily struggle to survive drew out into years, this second skin grew with her, and so too did her resolve. Now she had more than hope, she had a plan. Fight hard. Stay alive. Find a way back. She was transformed, from frightened girl to fearless survivor, from prey to predator. For almost a decade, she has lived between two worlds in an attempt to keep them apartвЂ”the Void hungers to consume not only the scattered villages of Shurima, but the whole of Runeterra. She will not allow that to happen. Though she has slain countless Void-constructs, she understands that many of the people she protects would see her as a monster herself. Indeed, her name has begun to pass into legend, an echo of the ancient horrors of doomed Icathia. No longer KaisaвЂ¦ but Kai\'Sa.', 'https://tinyurl.com/ya9bp8cl'),

From within, this voice bestowed upon him terrible purpose, and though Malzahar was no longer tormented by its call, the voice did not cease its unrelenting summons. This baleful beacon`s gentle flicker - now fastened to Runeterra - drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between the spaces which were never meant to meet. There amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, Kog`Maw manifested in Valoran with unsettling curiosity. The spark which led him to Runeterra teased him still, urging him gently towards Malzahar. It also encouraged him to familiarize himself with his new environment, to the stark horror of everything he encountered on his journey. The enchanting colors and aromas of Runeterra intoxicated Kog`Maw, and he explored the fruits of the strange world the only way he knew how: by devouring them. At first he sampled only the wild flora and fauna he happened across. As he traversed the parched Tempest Flats, however, he came upon a tribe of nomads. Seemingly unhampered by conventional rules of physics, Kog`Maw consumed every nomad and any obstacles they put in his way, amounting to many times his own mass and volume. The most composed of his victims may have had time to wonder if this was due to the caustic enzymes which stung the ground as they dripped from his gaping mouth, although such musings were abruptly concluded.

The only son of aging trinket peddlers, Malzahar did not realize his gift until his parents had already succumbed to a wasting sickness, leaving the young, traumatized boy to fend for himself on the city streets of Amakra. He read fortunes in the gutter, for a coin or scraps of bread. As his auguries proved more and more accurate, his reputation grew. He used his second sight to predict who a curious cameleer might marry, or where throwing daggers would land in games of chance at the bazaar. Soon, he began to receive patrons dressed not in dirtied sandals, but jeweled slippers. However, for all this, Malzahar could never see his own destiny. His future was hidden. Increasingly disillusioned with his success, he noted the common disparities of wealth, and witnessed those unhappy with their lives acting out in spiteful violence against one another. It was apparent to him that people were bound up in a never-ending cycle of pain, often of their own making, and no hopeful prophecy seemed able to break it. Malzahar himself soon felt nothing but a sense of emptiness, finally relinquishing his mortal possessions and leaving Amakra for good. For years, he roamed the land, from the trackless wastes of the lesser sai to the ruins of old Shurima. By distancing himself from others, he was alone with his thoughts at last. He divined not just how callous people could be, but also how corrupt the world might yet become. Feverish visions began to plague his waking hours, along with otherworldly whispers of war and strife, and endless suffering. He wandered far, until the sands turned to salt. He could not know that he had arrived in Icathia, a lost city ravaged in the wars of a bygone age. There, gazing into the depths of a ragged abyss, Malzahar opened his unsteady mind, desperate for understanding. And the Void answered. That would have been the end of any other tale, and yet somehow Malzahar endured. What lay in the darkness below brushed against the soul of the broken seer, only for an instant, and yet its strange and unknowable energies saturated his mind completely. The lone figure that eventually strode out of Icathia was no longer just a man, but something greater. Malzahar had seen in the abyss an end to all the suffering he had witnessed in his mortal lifetime. He realized the future he had believed hidden from him all this time was in fact a vision of his true calling: to accelerate the world toward inevitable oblivion. He had to return to the people, and spread word of the holy nothingness that would gladly embrace them, the willing and non-believers alike. He would become the herald of the world`s salvation. Among the nomads of the deep desert, he found his first disciples. Before their astonished eyes, he used his new Void-given powers to rend the very earth itself, summoning chittering, nightmarish creatures to carry away any who dared to deny him. Within a matter of months, strange rumors began to travel with the merchant caravans; rumors of men and women gladly sacrificing themselves to unseen powers, and of powerful quakes opening up the bedrock of Shurima in new fault lines hundreds of miles long. In the years since, Malzahar`s legend has spread even to the northern ports. As followers of вЂњthe ProphetвЂќ grow in number, nearby settlers are said to experience malefic visions grasping at their hearts, and fear gives rise to superstitionвЂ”even the hardy villagers of the far wastes now make offerings of livestock to appease the voidling creatures below.

(7, 'Rek\'Sai', 'The Void Burrower', 'Fighter', 'Low', 'Six boys and a camel, and the boys were cheaper to replace. Some were orphans and escaped slaves, but most were off casts вЂ” teenagers abandoned by families too poor to keep them. When Shahib offered him the work, Jaheje hadn`t eaten in days. Only the desperate would try crossing the Sai Kahleek, but those with any meager possessions bartered for Shahib. Jaheje looked across the cooking fire at the older boy. A few small tufts of facial hair had sprouted on Shahib`s cheeks, and his voice no longer cracked when he spoke. Few boys survived crossing the desert for more than a couple seasons. No one chose to do it after earning any money. No one except Shahib, who had walked the Sai Kahleek for almost ten years. Shahib whistled and the other boys ran to his side. He showed them how to cut the callouses from their feet. вЂњFeel each step,вЂќ he instructed. вЂњStart with your big toe, then roll outward until your whole foot touches down. Only then do you shift your weight from your rear foot.вЂќ He stood and demonstrated how to move with long, silent strides. вЂњPractice,вЂќ he explained. вЂњIf the camel walks too slowly, it will reveal our presence. You must be quiet, and you must be swift.вЂќ Jaheje`s feet bled badly the first day; he nearly fainted from the pain. He practiced long after the caravan stopped and the ground cooled. By the fourth day, the pain was so intense, he used a bit of leather to bite down on. Shahib complimented him on his technique. Shahib laughed as he indicated it to the other boys. вЂњWatch,вЂќ he said. вЂњJaheje is quieter than me. Copy how he moves. Each step as soft as a mouse, each stride as long as a gazelle. Yes, this is how you survive Sai Kahleek.вЂќ Longing as much for the older boy`s praise as the training he needed to survive, Jaheje soon followed him everywhere. He saw how Shahib rested with one foot raised and wrapped around the pendant spear. He saw how Shahib retied the spearвЂ™s pendant every morning, making sure the flag`s cut-cloth always flowed like the leaves of a desert palm. He saw how Shahib`s eyes searched the desert in a pattern, over and over, stopping only when he closed them for sleep. After the second moon, they arrived. From the top of the dunes, Jaheje looked down at the skeleton of the dead god. No one knew what the monster had been when alive, but its huge ribs raked into the sky, each casting a shadow that engulfed the caravan as they passed. Its bones meant they were entering the Sai Kahleek. Northerners called Sai Kahleek the вЂњBone Sea,вЂќ but this was a mistranslation. The Laaji tribes had never seen an ocean. Sai was the word the Laaji used for plains of sand and loosely packed rock, which were slow and painful to walk on. It meant the land was pockmarked with tunnels. It meant the Xer`Sai preyed here. It meant death lurked beneath the sand. Dragging the old camel behind them, the team of boys left before dawn, a half day`s march ahead of the caravan. Jaheje found his first burrow on the second day, and waved his signal flag. Shahib soft-stepped over to him. They approached the burrow cautiously and stopped a dozen yards from it. Its opening was no larger than a melon, but from it, the poisonous vapors of activity brewed. Shahib sent one of the boys back to redirect the caravan. Jaheje looked back and asked Shahib, вЂњCan we kill a Xer`Sai that large?вЂќ Shahib scratched his chin, responding, вЂњTheir skin gets harder with age.вЂќ Slowly, a grin appeared proudly. вЂњLast season I killed one the size of a jackal. We lost the camel, but I killed it.вЂќ Jaheje smiled, enjoying his mentor`s boast. But he found himself asking, вЂњDoes Rek`Sai exist?вЂќ Shahib chilled, his mood suddenly bitter. вЂњI have seen her.вЂќ But before Jaheje could ask about the famous beast, Shahib stood and told Jaheje to keep moving. They crept away from the burrow, listening, waiting, scanning the horizon for any movement. When Jaheje heard the first gong of a sounding bell, it took him a moment to process what it meant. Something was coming from behind them, to the east. He had been so focused on looking for hidden burrows, he had forgotten to watch the horizon. The camel brayed, and Jaheje looked for the signal spears of the other boys in his crew. At the edge of his visibility, he could see their three flags. The bell sounded again. The boy who had sighted the Xer`Sai would now use the sounding bell to confuse the beast. Jaheje had to chase the camel away from the path of the caravan and toward the lookout. Assuming the lookout wasn`t killed, the Xer`Sai would follow the camel away from the caravan and allow the lookout a safe path to retreat. Jaheje could see Shahib running toward him. The bone-thin teen had abandoned silent-stepping, racing as fast as he could toward the camel and Jaheje. Shahib dropped his spear as a cloud of dust suddenly appeared behind him. Jaheje ran to the huge king-bell attached to the camel. He dragged it down to the ground and struck it with all of his might. Even muffled by the earth, the sound battered his ears. He kept hitting, but the cloud of dust pursuing Shahib didn`t change course. Each second it gained ground. At the moment, it seemed certain to overtake Shahib. Instead of running or dodging, he froze and screamed, вЂњDon`t move!вЂќ The other boys stood as motionless as their bodies would allow. At the exact instant, the old camel began running. And then, before a word could be spoken, an energy crackle hit them like a wall. The hair on Jaheje`s neck stood on end. вЂњIt`s close,вЂќ Jaheje whispered. вЂњNo,вЂќ Shahib warned. вЂњIt`s not close. It`s big.вЂќ And for the first time Jaheje saw real fear on the older boy`s face. Shahib scanned the desert, looking for a fin, a dust cloud, anything. Then he judged the distance. вЂњThe caravan`s too far. If it heads for the camel we can make it to the rocks.вЂќ Jaheje desperately turned, looking for the hidden creature. вЂњWhere is it?!вЂќ In the distance, they heard the camel bray in pain. The animal`s screams ended suddenly. вЂњWhat could kill a camel that quickly?вЂќ Jaheje asked. Shahib pushed them forward. вЂњWe have to reach the rocks,вЂќ he insisted. And with that, they began to run. When Shahib told them to stop, they stopped. When he indicated for them to silent-step, they did so. Jaheje could only hope Shahib saw what he did not. But the black rocks seemed to run away from them. No matter how many steps they took, they never grew closer. So they ran as clouds covered the sun and the desert became black. They ran as the wind swept away their trail. They ran knowing the Xer`Sai was behind them; knowing it heard every misstep, every stumble. They ran knowing that it followed, and that every mistake led it closer. When Jaheje saw it, it seemed to be a giant mouth cut into the rock, vapors hissing from it menacingly. The burrow`s entrance was so large, even standing upright, he would be able to walk into it without lowering his head. вЂњRek`Sai,вЂќ he whispered in terrified awe. As he turned, he realized that all around them, the black stone was pockmarked with the creature`s giant tunnels. Young Xalee gave voice to the horrible realization that they all understood: вЂњShe can tunnel through rock.вЂќ The cliffs they had thought to be their salvation were instead Rek`SaiвЂ™s lair. вЂњWe should go back, try and reach the caravan,вЂќ Xalee suggested. вЂњTry if you like,вЂќ Shahib answered. вЂњWe can silent-step.вЂќ вЂњA day`s travel,вЂќ Shahib cautioned. вЂњCan you travel soundlessly for a whole day?вЂќ вЂњWhat will you do Shahib?вЂќ Jaheje asked. вЂњIf we go back, we will die in the Sai Kahleek. I will go forward and pray a guardian watches over me.вЂќ Xalee asked, вЂњWhere does this valley lead?вЂќ вЂњIt doesn`t matter where it leads. It is our only choice.вЂќ They moved cautiously along the cliffs, entering a wind cut valley, and hoping it would lead to water soon. Avoiding the monstrous burrows was impossible. Each boy silently prayed Rek`Sai had heard, and pursued, the distant caravan instead of them. As the sunlight crept over the edge of the valley, it revealed the desolate obstacle they faced. It was impossible to walk silently in the canyon, for bones were scattered underfoot. The sound of each footstep echoed with a hollow lifelessness. She launched from an unseen hole behind them, which had appeared dead. For Jaheje, everything became a blur. вЂњBack!вЂќ Shahib screamed to the others. вЂњGet downwind!вЂќ The warning was already too late for Xalee. The creature brought down the boy like a wolf taking a mouse. Her huge fangs snapped Xalee`s spine, killing him before he could cry out. Rek`Sai loomed above Jaheje, twice his height. Her powerful forelimbs stalked left and right. Her leech-like tail, many times the size of an alligator, dragged behind her body. Her long tongue rose, then swayed like a dancing cobra, sniffing the wind. Jaheje could feel every muscle in his body aching to move. He stood transfixed as the huge Xer`Sai turned toward him. Gore covered the beast`s eyeless face and armored beak. Rek`Sai was so alien and perfect in her deadliness, Jaheje felt his mouth open in awe. The boy gripped his spear staff, certain he wouldn`t be able to pierce her armored hide if she attacked. вЂњDown!вЂќ Shahib barked. All the boys ducked flat to the earth as Rek`SaiвЂ™s вЂњfinвЂќ pulsed a sickly green color. Jaheje could feel the invisible energy crackling above him. The Xer`Sai turned, facing the distant caravan. Her tongue sniffed the air again, and considered the distance. Suddenly, the fin returned to its original violet color, and Rek`Sai pulled Xalee`s body down into her burrow. Save the pool of thickening blood and Xalee`s absence, no evidence of the great beast remained. Shahib whispered to go. The survivors silently retreated, deeper into the canyon. No one spoke. The dark stone, pockmarked with burrows, robbed them of the ability to speak, to cry, to mourn. Breaking free of the spell, his exhaustion cast over him. Jaheje looked around the canyon walls. He realized in an instant the enormity of what stalked them and why Shahib had decided to press on. Since Omah`Azir`s time, when stone was clay and Shurima built itself to the sun, Rek`Sai had fed here. This valley was hers alone. And all believed the Xer`Sai existed only to eat. вЂњBut why do they stay here?вЂќ Jaheje said aloud. Suddenly, the monster appeared. She burst out of the ground in front of them, diving at Jaheje. Jaheje ducked as Rek`Sai soared past him, her mass blocking the sun. As she landed, her forelimbs ripped apart the ground and she disappeared beneath the surface. Hidden in the brush, VezKah, the youngest boy, motioned Jaheje closer. Just then, his mouth opened in horror. A pulse of dark energy ripped from RekвЂ™Sai`s fin, tearing apart the earth as she rushed toward VezKah. The earth cracked apart as Rek`Sai ripped the ground up and threw the boy into the air. VezKah landed in a heap as the huge fin rushed toward them. Together, Shahib and Jaheje ran out of the gully as quickly as they could. The creature lurched forward, then slowed a rhythm, which matched the swerving pattern of her pursuit. She pushed them even further into the valley, blocking any other road of escape. Silent-stepping was meaningless now. Rek`Sai was too close. All that was left was to run. When Caleeb lost his breath, Rek`Sai took him. Seeing this, Shahib stopped. He collected Caleeb`s spear and waited. All around him, the air churned and bent like a reflection in the water. вЂњWhat are you doing?вЂќ Jaheje whispered. вЂњI will be the camel. Go silently.вЂќ Shahib acknowledged the walls around them. вЂњTell people what you have seen here.вЂќ Jaheje followed Shahib`s eyeline. Behind him, the stone cliffs had been cut apart by burrows into a pattern of intersecting circles. From them, a bizarre connection of ink-black energy flowed and dripped like a sticky liquid. And through this matrix, an incompressible reality bent and twisted as someplace else prepared itself to enter our world. Hidden in this isolated valley, the true lair of Xer`Sai was a half-constructed tunnel. A tunnel to the nightmare place where these creatures had been born, and fouler things waited hungrily at this unfinished gateway to our world. вЂњKeep going, Jaheje,вЂќ Shahib said with a tired smile. вЂњEach step as soft as a mouse, each stride as long as a gazelle. You must survive the Sai Kahleek.вЂќ Jaheje made it to the far cliff before he heard the scream. Turning to look, Jaheje rolled his foot down, then slid his heel to the ground just as Shahib had taught him. He did this as his teacher was reduced to the sound of bones snapping, and the great beast chewing. Jaheje watched as Rek`Sai opened her maw and pulled a sticky ball of dark energy from Shahib`s ruined body. The ball rotated as tendrils dripped to the ground, sticking and stretching as Rek`Sai manipulated it into a pattern, which she attached between two of the burrows. Jaheje looked away, then turned silently and soft-stepped out of the valley. Jaheje ran out of sweat the next day. He felt his dry eyes scratching against his eyelids. His lips swelled, then split open bloodlessly. When his calf muscles locked in a cramp from dehydration, and he was no longer able to soft-step, only then did he fall to the ground to cry. He cried for the days of hunger he`d suffered before joining Shahib`s caravan. He cried for knowing his parents off cast him instead of his brothers. He cried for Shahib, the first person who`d shown him kindness. And it was those last tears that dragged him back onto his cramped legs and made him stand. Knowing each shaky and tired step revealed his position to any Xer`Sai nearby, Jaheje stumbled onward. When Jaheje reached the great river Renek and told his story, few believed him. But soon, those who tried to cross the Sai Kahleek with any meager possessions left, bartered for Jaheje. And Jaheje taught off cast boys how to cut the callouses from their feet and how to soft-step by rolling their heel. He taught them how to survive the Sai Kahleek, and he warned his students of the monster named Rek\'Sai.', 'https://tinyurl.com/y9hu5fc8'),
(8, 'Vel\'Koz', 'The eye of The Void', 'Mage', 'High', 'To truly understand the horror that is Vel`Koz, one must first know of the Watchers, and how they were blinded to the mortal realm. Beyond the material plane, outside and somehow below it, lies the unknowable abyss. It is the realm of the Void, where no mortal or immortal creature may ever walk. It is not necessary to know how such a place ever came to be, nor whyвЂ”only that it did. The Void is eternal. The Void consumes all. In that place, in the cold, endless dark, all is equal and empty. For timeless eons, there was purity in that fact. There was peace, if such a term could have any meaning there. Then, something changed. Not in the Void realm, but elsewhere. It was existence, it was... something, where before there had been nothing, and it`s mere presence scraped against the vast, cold, formless entities that drifted in the blackness. Before this, they had not even been fully aware of their own sentience, and yet now they knew that they could not tolerate the presence of this other place; this other-realm of mercurial, overwhelming creation. The entities watched. They scrutinized. And soon enough, the Watchers found themselves being scrutinized in return. The tiny, mortal minds that reached out to them were insignificant, little more than fleeting motes of light at the very edges of the abyss. Yet, in them, the Watchers saw a chance to invade the material realm, to destroy it, to silence the intolerable pulsing of reality beyond the Void. The boldest of them tore open the veil and hurled themselves upward, only to be horribly disoriented by the sudden shift between the abyss and the corporeal, linear nature of reality. In an instant, there was time, and heat, and pain... Then there was only cold. The way was shut, and dozens of the Watchers were trapped in the liminal space between two realms, frozen in the moment of transition. Those that remained in the Void recoiled. They had no concept of what had happened, yet they knew they had been betrayed. And so, they adapted. Reaching into the material realm, the Watchers took from the crude matter that comprised it, shaping, corrupting and imbuing it with consciousness. These constructs were the first of the Voidborn, and would be their masters` eyes and ears, sent forth into the nightmare of existence to watch, listen, and learn. Among them, one stands apart. As perhaps the oldest surviving Voidborn, certainly existing the longest outside of the abyss, he has been known by countless names to those unfortunate enough to encounter him. Thousands of years before Icathia unleashed the Void in battle, the primitive cultures of Shurima feared the devil Vel`Koz, who crept forth from the underworld to steal the dreams of wiser men. Though his name has no literal translation in the modern tongue, it equates roughly as вЂњto understand by unmaking.вЂќ His insatiable hunger for knowledge has led Vel`Koz across the world, to it`s highest peaks and darkest depths. Cunning and methodical, he has quietly watched entire civilizations rise, stagnate and decay, spent centuries combing the ocean floor for its secrets, even scrying the movements of the stars in the heavens above him. He carries all of this knowledge back to the great rifts in the fabric of RuneterraвЂ”so that the Watchers might know what he knowsвЂ”and will annihilate, without hesitation, any mortal who stands in his path. For the Void is eternal, and it will consume us all.', 'https://tinyurl.com/ycpgf7rq'),
